# Next.js Best Practices
- Use App Router structure with `page.tsx` in route directories
- Client components must have `'use client'` directive at top
- Directory naming: kebab-case (e.g., `components/auth-form`)
- Component files: PascalCase (e.g., `SearchBar.tsx`)
- Prefer named exports: `export function Button()` over `export default`
- Minimize client components:
  - Use React Server Components (RSC) for data fetching
  - Wrap interactive elements in small client components
  - Use `Suspense` with fallback UI for client components
- State management:
  - Use URL search params for shareable state
  - Implement `nuqs` for URL state management
  - Use React Query for server-state synchronization
- Forms: Use React Server Actions for form handling
